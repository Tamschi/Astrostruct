Astrostruct
===========

A multi-platform, open-source, highly-modifiable, multi-player, space-themed, rogue-like game.

How do I play it?
--------------------

Use cmake to generate the game binaries in your favorite os, then play the game!

I want to use your code as a learning resource!

Oh do you now? Good thing I have everything heavily documented.
