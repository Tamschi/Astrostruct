Astrostruct
===========

A multi-platform, open-source, highly-modifiable, multi-player, space-themed, rogue-like game.

How do I play it?
--------------------

Run CMake inside of the ./cmake folder using your favorite os. It will generate a binary ready for use inside the folder ./bin.

I want to use your code as a learning resource!
